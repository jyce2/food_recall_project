Final Project Guidelines
Guidance concerning your BIOS 669 project for Spring 2024

Instead of an in-class final examination, at the end of the semester I will have you turn in a final project of your own choosing.  This project should be non-trivial and should illustrate application and mastery of skills learned in this course (as well as its prerequisites).  Basically, it should involve meaningful work with data. 
Since the final project for BIOS 669 is totally your choice, you should ideally find something that will be an interesting learning experience for yourself.  On the other hand, if you’ve got a really busy semester, then you might go for expediency and choose a project that lets you piggyback on work that you are already doing anyway, such as your Master’s or undergraduate honors thesis, PhD dissertation, or current project for your GRA. If you are working on a thesis this semester, it’s likely that you can take a part of that and make it into your 669 project. 
What you will turn in is an organized zip file that contains a document that tells me how I should approach the zipped materials.  Such materials should definitely include a brief paper, SAS code, and SAS logs (which should be clean as usual!), and the zipped materials could also include data in various forms, copies of the surveys/forms used to collect the data (or links to those forms online), codebooks that describe the data (or links to those codebooks online), RTF or PDF files, HTML files, a Python program used for web scraping, etc.  When possible (and if it doesn’t violate confidentiality restrictions), I would like you to turn in the data with your project, or possibly point me to where I can find the data on the web.  Being able to see/use the data would be very helpful to me in evaluating your work.  But I understand that this will not always be possible. 
Each project is to be individually done.  You can discuss your work with others, but turn in your own project. 
The project will be worth the equivalent of five regular assignments, or about one-sixth of your course grade.  I will evaluate your work based on both ambition and execution, and remember that it’s the last piece of your work that I will see, so it could have a huge impact on my impression of what you have learned and what you can do.  Here are some areas where you could excel: 
•	Choosing an ambitious but realistic project so that you can really do what you set out to do.
•	Choosing and executing appropriate programming techniques for the project work.
•	Writing very clear, readable, understandable code.
•	Applying principles covered in the course, such as always checking derived variables.
•	An excellent write-up of your work, including descriptions of your goals, the data you are using, the methods you applied, and your results and findings.
•	Creating effective displays (tables and graphs) to show your discoveries.

Additional thoughts
It will make me very happy if you take the opportunity to use tools from this course for your project whenever they make sense.  Specifically, your project work could possibly benefit from the following: 
•	Data checking and cleaning (and if you find very bad problems correct them with a detailed comment in the log that explains exactly what you are doing)
•	Following the twenty analysis data set guidelines (see that set of notes)
•	Checking any derived variables as we did in our variable-checking exercise
•	Using the exclusions macro to analyze exclusions as you make your analysis data set
•	Using the comparative table macro to compare your fundamental groups, if this concept applies to your data (RPTC)
•	Producing a codebook to describe your data (MTDC)
What will make me even happier is if I see that you’ve used this course as a jumping off point for meaningful work with data.
